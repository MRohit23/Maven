                It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life.
                When a person leads a disciplined life, they set an easy path to
                success. They will develop an approach to happiness and a
                beautiful future ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of
                having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be
                punctual and hard-working. An individual is taught what being
                disciplined mean from the time they are young. Even though
                discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a
                disciplined life make it a worthwile endeavour.
